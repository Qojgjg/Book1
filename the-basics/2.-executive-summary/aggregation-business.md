# Aggregation Business

Every industry in todayâ€™s time has been disrupted by the aggregator business model. This concept, which is frequently mistaken with other types of platforms, typically entails organizing together a variety of products and brands under one brand for a highly populated sector, such as cabs, hotels, travel, groceries, food, and so on.

To put it in another way, the aggregator may serve as a sort of middleman, but unlike other platforms, it has complete control over its users' experience. The rise of internet was also instrumental in this. The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn the traditional value-chain on its head. To begin with, the Internet has made distribution (of digital goods) completely free, eliminating the competitive advantage that pre-Internet distributors had in integrating with suppliers. Second, because the Internet has eliminated transaction costs, a distributor can now integrate forward with end users/consumers at scale.

This has fundamentally changed the plane of competition: no longer do distributors compete based upon exclusive supplier relationships, with consumers/users an afterthought. Instead, suppliers can be commoditized leaving consumers/users as a first-order priority. By extension, this means that the most important factor determining success is the user experience.

The best distributors/aggregators/market-makers win by providing the best experience, which earns them the most consumers/users, which attracts the most suppliers, which enhances the user experience in a virtuous cycle.

Some famous aggregation businesses:

**Amazon**

Previously, book publishers bundled editing, marketing, and distribution into a single package. First with e-commerce, then via e-books, Amazon modularized distribution. Customer data and payment information were combined with e-book distribution and Amazon's publishing initiative (the framework is most evident when it comes to books, but the integration of distribution and customer relationships applies to most of Amazon's operations).

**Netflix**

Before Netflix, networks integrated broadcast availability with content. Netflix modularized broadcast availability by making its entire library available at any time in any order to ensure access to entertainment highly convenient to its users and hence the best user experience. It integrated content purchases and customer management, enabling a virtuous cycle of increased subscription demand and increased content purchase capability.

**Uber**

In the Pre-Uber era, taxi companies integrated dispatch and fleet management. Uber modularized fleet management by working with independent drivers. Uber integrated dispatch with customer management which eventually enabled it to scale to become a global brand.

**Airbnb**

Post Housing Crisis Airbnb came as a boon to the vacation rental and homestay services. Before Airbnb, the hotel industry worked on integration of vacant rooms and trust (via brand). Airbnb built a reputation system for trust between hosts and guests, thus democratising the vacant property management for not only hotels but also for house owners. The integration of property management and customer management, enabled Airbnb to become such a big brand that even Covid Pandemic could not destroy it.
