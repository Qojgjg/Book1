# 5. Kuiper Mint (Kuiper Minting platform)

Minting is a tedious and specific step in the process of generation of a Non-Fungible Token (NFT). The most pronounced problem while minting an NFT on almost all minting platforms is the high and often unreliable gas fee. This has been the most serious obstacle in the integration of artists en masse to the blockchain network.

Kuiper Minting platform is a boon to NFT creators. Earlier, NFT creators had to finalise a blockchain network and accordingly choose a platform for minting their NFTs. Kuiper Mint solves this pain of creators by providing access to multiple blockchain networks on one screen, so that they can very conveniently choose which blockchain network they want to mint their NFT.

The creators can easily check and compare the minting fees on different blockchains on a unified platform \[Kuiper Mint] and take an informed and wise decision while minting their NFTs. Further all the minted NFTs across several blockchains can be accessed on a single platform thus neutralising the need of visiting multiple websites for NFTs minted in different blockchain networks.
