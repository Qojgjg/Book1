# What is Kuiper Museum?

Kuiper Museum is a virtual world 3D museum built on metaverse that can house multiple NFTs in a well decorated and elegant virtual space. It allows NFT collectors to have an immersive experience while browsing the NFTs displayed into it. Visitors can get a feel of real-world museum where they can get the best browsing experience of 2D, 3D and even animated NFTs on one screen without the hassle of opening each NFT separately. This is a one of its kind and has never been done before for the NFT creators or collectors.
