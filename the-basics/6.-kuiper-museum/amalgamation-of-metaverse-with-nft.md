# Amalgamation of metaverse with NFT

Currently, all the NFTs in general and different NFTs of a creator, in particular, are listed on web platforms in an old 2D fashion which when it comes to the world of art is very boring and monotonous. This has not helped either of creators, viewers or buyers and brings monotonicity to the world of art. Kuiper Museum aims to revolutionize this space by introducing the concept of virtual 3D museums built on metaverse while providing an immersive experience to all the users. NFTs are unique art works of creators minted over a particular blockchain. While NFTs are manifestations of artist creativity, it suffers a major drawback of being listed over a boring 2D webpage or marketplace. Kuiper has developed a unique solution to this problem by developing a state of art metaverse 3D museum which offers a complete immersive art experience to artists as well as visitors. Creators have the facility to list their NFTs minted over different blockchains in a single metaverse museum while the collectors and investors have a wonderful opportunity of experiencing those magnificent artworks in the Kuiper Museum and interact with artists and several other visitors inside the museum.
